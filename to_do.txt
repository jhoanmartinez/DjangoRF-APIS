A user must be authenticated to access a poll or the list of polls.
• Create User ===> Done •
• Only an authenticated users can create a poll.
• Only an authenticated user can create a choice.
• Authenticated users can create choices only for polls they have created.
• Authenticated users can delete only polls they have created.
• Only an authenticated user can vote. Users can vote for other people’s polls.

To enable the access control, we need to add two more APIs
• API to create a user, we will call this endpoint /users/
• API to verify a user and get a token to identify them, we will call this endpoint /login/
